## What is Agents Home?

# A no-code 3D playground to explore, design, and interact with Agentic AI systems

This project is designed for **AI enthusiasts, educators, and creative developers** looking to understand multi-agent collaboration in a living 3D office without writing a single line of code.

## Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies:**

```bash
npm install
```

2. **Run the development server:**

```bash
npm run dev
```

3. **Open the app:** Navigate to the local URL shown in your terminal (usually `http://localhost:3000/agents-home/`).

## Features

### Agentic AI System (v0.2.0)

- **Team Editor (React Flow):** Create your own [multi-agent design patterns](https://developers.googleblog.com/developers-guide-to-multi-agent-patterns-in-adk/) using an interactive node-based interface.
- **6 Predefined Teams:** Industry-specific templates (Creative Agency, Film Studio, PR Agency, etc.) to get you started.
- **Text-only build (DeepSeek):** Runs the full simulation and agent workflow using DeepSeek’s OpenAI-compatible API.
- **Per-Agent LLM:** Assign different DeepSeek models per agent (recommended: `deepseek-v4-pro` for leads/reasoning, `deepseek-v4-flash` for workers).
- **Cost & Token Tracking:** Real-time estimation of usage costs and token consumption (DeepSeek V4 pricing).
- **PR-style Workflows:** Learn about Pull Request and Review workflows where agents with `human-in-the-loop` properties require your approval to proceed.
- **Guardrails:** Controlled generation with the `Auto-approve output` option, ensuring quality before final asset production.
- **Technical Logs:** Improved visibility into raw LLM traces, tool calls, and structured agent responses.
- **Team Health Tab:** Quick view of agent status, model, token usage, and estimated cost.

### Embodied Simulation

- **Hybrid GPU/CPU Architecture:** A high-performance **3D simulation** built with **Three.js WebGPU** where autonomous LLM-powered characters collaborate in a shared physical workspace.
- **Intelligent Pathfinding:** NPCs utilize a NavMesh to navigate the office, finding and claiming specific "Points of Interest" (desks, seats, computers) based on their current task. Pathfinding is powered by [three-pathfinding](https://github.com/donmccurdy/three-pathfinding).
- **Dynamic State Machine:** Characters transition naturally between walking, sitting, working, and talking, with sync'ed 3D speech bubbles and expressions.

### Interactive UI

- **Team Flow Visualizer:** Real-time node-based view of your agent hierarchy and task flows.
- **Simulated PR Reviews:** Interactive modals for reviewing agent proposals, providing feedback, and merging tasks.
- **Real-time 3D Overlay:** Status indicators and interaction menus projected from 3D space into a polished UI.
- **Agent Inspector:** Select any agent to view their "thoughts", mission, and history.
- **Kanban & Action Logs:** Complete transparency into the agency's progress and tool-level interactions.

## Tech Stack Deep Dive

- **Engine:** [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) (WebGPU & TSL) for advanced rendering and compute.
- **UI:** [React](https://react.dev/) & [React Flow](https://reactflow.dev/) for node-based team visualization.
- **AI:** [DeepSeek API](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/) via OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions.
- **State:** [Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand) for a unified, reactive store across the 3D world and React UI.
- **3D Assets:** Custom models and animations rigged in [Blender](https://blender.org), using an instanced animation system.

## Roadmap

- **World Building**
    - [ ] **Office/3D Space Editor:** Drag-and-drop workspace layout and POI customization.
    - [ ] **Dynamic Environment:** Real-time prop generation and environment modification by agents.
- **Advanced Interactions**
    - [ ] **Advanced Embodied AI:** Deeper integration between agent reasoning and physical 3D world actions.
    - [ ] **Enhanced Animations:** Richer character expressions and more fluid, context-aware animations.
    - [ ] **Human-Agent Spatial Interaction:** Direct collaboration and richer multi-party interactions in the 3D office.
    - [ ] **Inter-Agent Knowledge Sharing:** Long-term memory for agent teams across projects.
- **Refinement**
    - [ ] **Architecture Decoupling:** Further separation of core logic from the simulation environment.
    - [ ] **UX/UI Overhaul:** Unified CSS styling based on "The Delegation" brand identity.

## Developer Note

This project is a fork of [The Delegation](https://github.com/arturitu/the-delegation) adapted for a DeepSeek-first workflow.
